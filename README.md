# SNHUCourseWork
The Project that I submitted is Project 3, which focused on using multiple languages in one program.
I think I executed the code well for never having worked with two languages in a single program.
I would check my code over for repetition and make sure that it was clean and easily read.
I found the integrating of the two languages difficult since it was my first time. I used the texts provided to find the solutions I needed.
Understanding the pros and cons of different languages and how to use them together will be something that I use in the future.
